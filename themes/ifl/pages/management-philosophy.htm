							<h2>Value To Customer</h2>

						<div class="aux-description">
							<p>The market leaders are always and have always been those companies that provide the most perceived value to their customers. This is the most important part of Quality Assurance that most people do not take into consideration.</p>
							<p>This particular aspect begins when our product, yarn or polyester, enters the premises of our customer. Our technical staff personally visits the customer to ensure smooth running of our product.</p>
							<p>It also ensures that the customer is well satisfied by the performance of our product. Therefore, the Quality Journey does not end within the four walls of our mills. It goes beyond our physical boundaries and expectations of our customers!</p>
